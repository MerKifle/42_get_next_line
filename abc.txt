Are you using any other libraries in your project?

I'm getting compile errors using both Cocoa and Carbon using apple's template projects, however I notice that sleep functions (using the definition) are a feature in both the SDL and SFML cross platform libraries, and perhaps for many others.

Have you tried your code example on a template project using only with apples libraries?

It could be that Sleep() is a function in something else you are linking to.
